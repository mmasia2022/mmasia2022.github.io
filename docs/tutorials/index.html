<h2 id=tutorial1>✏️ Synthetic Data and Multimedia</h2>
<h3 id=time-december-13-100-pm---300-pm>Time: December 13, 1:00 pm - 3:00 pm</h3>
<h3 id=abstract>Abstract</h3>
<p>Image and video processing has seen a rapid growth in the last decade, with remarkable improvements made possible thanks to the availability of ever-increasing computing power as well as deep learning-based frameworks that now allow human-like and beyond performances in many applications, including detection, classification, segmentation, to name a few.
However, it is to be noted that the development of novel algorithms and solutions is strictly bound to the availability of a relevant amount of data, which must be representative of the task that needs to be addressed.
With this respect, the literature has shown a rapid proliferation of datasets, tackling a multitude of problems, from the simplest to the most complex ones. Some of them are largely adopted and are currently recognized as the reference benchmark against which all newly proposed methods need to compete. Still, there is an ever growing demand for data, to which researchers respond with larger and larger datasets, at a huge cost in terms of acquisition, storage, and annotation of images and clips, often facing inconsistencies in annotations.
The use of synthetically-generated data can overcome such limitations, as the generation engine can be designed to fulfill an arbitrary number of requirements, all at the same time.
The tutorial will take a holistic view on the ongoing research, the relevant issues, and the potential application of using synthetic data for multimedia data processing, as a standalone resource or in combination with real data. In particular, the attention will be focused on the domain of images and videos, where the lack of representative data for specific problem categories has let emerge the possibility of relying on machine-generated contents.</p>

<h2 id=tutorial2>✏️ Human-centric Visual Understanding</h2>
<h3 id=time-december-13-300-pm---500-pm>Time: December 13, 3:00 pm - 5:00 pm</h3>
<h3 id=abstract-1>Abstract</h3>
<p>Human-centric visual understanding is one of the fundamental problems of computer vision and multimedia understanding. With the development of deep learning and multi-modalities analysis techniques, researchers have strived to push the limits of human-centric visual understanding in a wide variety of applications, such as intelligent surveillance, retailing, fashion design, and services. This tutorial will present recent advances under the umbrella of human-centric visual understanding, ranging from the fundamental problems of gait recognition, monocular real-time 3D human recovery, human action understanding, and motion prediction, human action analysis in surveillance videos, finally to multimedia event analysis and understanding in complex scenarios and industrial applications. We will discuss the key problems, common formulations, existing methodologies, real industrial applications, future directions, etc. The views of our tutorial not only come from the research field but also combine the real-world requirements and experiences in the industrial community. Therefore, this tutorial will inspire audiences from the research and industrial community, and facilitate research in computer vision and multimedia for human behavior analysis and human-centric analysis modeling. We held a tutorial on the same topic for the first time in ACM Multimedia Asia 2019, so we mainly introduce our work from 2019 to 2022 in this tutorial.</p>
