Students must apply for a travel grant prior to the conference. Successful awardees can include their registration fee, via a complimentary registration from the conference, as part of their award. To enable more students to be benefited from attending ACMMM Asia, students don&amp;rsquo;t have to have a paper at the conference in order to apply for a SIGMM travel award.</description></item><item><title>We are accepting applications for student travel grants</title><link>https://www.mmasia2022.org/blog/2022/10/01/info-of-student-travel_grants-released/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mmasia2022.org/blog/2022/10/01/info-of-student-travel_grants-released/</guid><description>Check it for applying to student travel grants here!</description></item><item><title>Deadline Extended: Tutorial Proposals</title><link>https://www.mmasia2022.org/blog/2022/08/26/deadline-extended-3rd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.mmasia2022.org/blog/2022/08/26/deadline-extended-3rd/</guid><description>The deadline for tutorial proposals has been extended to September 9th.
